# vaultwarden-fly.io
Quick guide on getting Vaultwarden running on fly.io!


## Setup
Setup should be relatively simple, but does require a few steps:
- Create your app using `fly launch`
- Create a volume using `fly volume create`
- Create and store your admin token (used to access vaultwarden admin panel) by running `fly secrets set ADMIN_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'` where YOUR_TOKEN_HERE is your desired password to access the admin panel.
- Replace the autogenerated fly.toml file with the one in this repo
- Fill in your app name, and volume name in fly.toml where prompted
- Deploy using `fly deploy`
- Enjoy

## Updating your server
Luckily the maintainers of vaultwarden have made it really easy to upgrade your vaultwarden instance- Simply re-run `fly deploy` (If you desire a specific image version, update the image tag in the [build] section, and then deploy.)
